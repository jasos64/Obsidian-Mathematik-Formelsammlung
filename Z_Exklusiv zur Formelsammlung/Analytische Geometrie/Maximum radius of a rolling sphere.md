Two lines $g:\vec{x}$ and $h:\vec{x}$ are given.
- $g:\vec{x}=\vec{p}+\lambda\vec{v}$
- $h:\vec{x}=\vec{q}+\mu\vec{u}$

Suppose a sphere $S$ with radius $r>0$ rolls on $g$ tangentially.
Additionaly $r$ should not be chosen such that $h$ is $S$.
>The greatest value of $r$ needs to be determined where $\left|S\cap h\right|\le1$.

Because the radius of $S$ is unchanged during its' movement, the center $M$ is always parallel to $g$ with distance $r$.
There is a line $m:\vec{x}$, that contains all $M$, and thus is parallel to $g$.
- $M\in m$
- $d\left(M;g\right)=r$
- $m\parallel g$.

There may exist a point $M$, where both $g$ and $h$ are touching $S$ at one point. For such $M$, the distance of $M$ to $g$ is equal to that of $M$ to $h$. Both these distances will be equal to $r$ as previously stated.
$$d\left(M;g\right)=d\left(M;h\right)=r$$

## Construction of $m:\vec{x}$
Because $m$ has a distance of $r$ to $g$, a vector $\vec{n}$ with length $r$ perpendicular to $g$ can be constructed which will represent $m.$ There is a group of vectors that can represent that vector $n$.
- $\vec{n}\perp g$
- $\left|\vec{n}\right|=r$
Because it may be important where the sphere rolls on $g$, let $\theta=0$ be the vector $\vec{n}$ that is in the $x_3-g$ plane and "above" $g$.
- $E\parallel g \wedge E\parallel x_3$
- $E:\left(x_3\times\vec{v}\right)\circ\vec{x}=\left(x_3\times\vec{v}\right)\circ\vec{p}$
- $\vec{n}\in E$
