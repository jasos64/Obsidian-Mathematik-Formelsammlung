# Act 1, Scene 7

[Macbeth castle, near the dining hall. Torches indicate that it is evening. Servants carry dishes across the stage on their way to set up for dinner. Enter Macbeth.]

### Macbeth

It would be best to get this over with as it is everything. If the assasination would be a net which could collects all the potential consequences, then I would risk the assasination, even though consequences are still following.
Not to forget that those deadly actions do intend others to execute the same (deadly) action to others, but most importantly eventually to the initial actor.

Duncan trusts me twice, as kinsmen and his subject.
Besides this, Duncan is a very honest and pure in what he does.


*I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other..*

[Enter Lady Macbeth]

You have news?

### Lady Macbeth

He is almost done eating supper. Why did you leave?

### Macbeth

Did he ask for my presence?

### Lady Macbeth

*Know you not he has?*

### Macbeth

I will halt the course of our plan.
He did honor me and I since then gathered *golden opinions* from all sorts of people.
I should keep this as it is and not throw it aside.

### Lady Macbeth

Are you not the real Macbeth from earlyer? Are you ill?
Are you afraid to act what you desire?

*Wouldst thou have that which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, and live a coward in thine own esteem, letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,' like the poor cat i' the adage?

### Macbeth

I beg you!
I strive anything to be a man, but this totally is not!

### Lady Macbeth

What took over you when you said what you wanted to do?
If you kill Duncan, this would make you something greater than man.
Then, the moment was not perfect back then but you persisted on following the plan. Now the moment is perfect and you retreat.

### Macbeth

What if we fail?

### Lady Macbeth

We fail?
As long as you keep your courage together we will not fail.
When Duncan is asleep, which will happen soon because of his journey, I will make his chamberlains forget anything that happens then by using wine.
When they drunkenly sleep, Duncan is unguarded and we can do whatever we please.
And later on we can blame them.

### Macbeth

Are you sure that making it look like that they did it by using blood on their daggers is enough to convey innocence?

### Lady Macbeth

Who would think otherwise when we fill the castle with grief?

### Macbeth

I am sure now that we can do this. I will use all of my strengh to accomplish this terrible thing.
Leave and spread friendlyness to hide what we are about to do
