# Act 1, Scene 4

[Forres, the royal castle. Trumpets. Enter King Duncan, his sons Malcolm and Donalbain, Lord Lennox and Attendants.]

### Duncan

Is the execution done on Cawdor? Are not those in commission yet returned?

### Malcolm

My lord, they have not yet come back. But I have spoken with one that saw him die, who did report that he confessed his treasons, and also begged for your highness' pardon.

### Duncan

There's no way to find what a person has in mind just by looking at their face.
Cawdor was a gentleman on whom I built an absolute trust.

[Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus]

Oh worthiest cousin, I feel guilty for not giving you enough gratitude.

I would like to provide more gratitude towards you, but what I can offer is not closely enough to what you deserve.

If only the amount of gratitude you deserve would be lower, then my offerings would be reasonable.

### Macbeth

The service and the loyalty I owe you pays itself.

Your duty is to receive our loyalty. At the other hand, our duties are no more than to do everything to protect your love an honor.
### Duncan

~~Welcome hither.I have begun to plant thee, and will laborTo make thee full of growing~~

[to Banquo]
Noble Banquo,
you deserve as much as Macbeth. Let me bring you close and hold you to my heart.

### Banquo

If I grow to greatness, that would benefit us both.

### Duncan

All of this makes me tear in joy.
I proclaim to my sons, relatives and thanes, that from now on, my eldest son Malcom, will take my throne why we call him Prince of Cumberland now;
You will not be left alone with gaining new titles, but those who deserve will profit too.

_[To Macbeth]_ From hence we visit your caslte now,

**for that you will be drowned with honors**.

### Macbeth

Any efford towards your wellbeing does not feel like work.
At last, I will step back to be the messenger for those news.

### Duncan

My worthy Cawdor.

### Macbeth

_[Aside]_ The Prince of Cumberland — because Malcom now is Prince, he is in my way to become king. I would have to cut before him or drop my hopes.
Stars, exstinguish your light such that my evil desires are hidden.

The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be

Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

[Exit]

### Duncan

[In the middle of a conversaion with Banquo]
Let's follow him,
Macbeth is going ahead to prepare for our visit.

[Trumpets sound, all exit]
